# Speech Emotion Recognition 
### This is a simple and interactive web app that can tell what emotion someone is feeling just by listening to their voice. You can upload a .wav audio file, and the app will show the emotion it hearsâ€”along with a spectrogram (a colorful sound graph) and a matching emoji.It uses deep learning and audio processing tools like TensorFlow, librosa, and is built with Streamlit to run on the web.

## What This App Does:
### Accepts .wav audio files as input

### Extracts meaningful audio features (MFCCs, chroma, spectral contrast, etc.)

### Loads a pre-trained CNN model

### Predicts one of the predefined emotion categories

Displays:

 1. The predicted emotion

2.  A mel-spectrogram of the uploaded audio

3.  An emoji representing the detected emotion
